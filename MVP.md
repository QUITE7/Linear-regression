the figure represented in heatmap plot, the above figure shows the relations between the features in range between -1 to 1

1- the plot show that price has a correlation with area

2-the plot show that rooms has a lower correlation with bathrooms

the table above shows the error validation techniques and the used regression models

### the error values measured in five methods

1-MAE

2-MSE

3-RMSE

4-R2 square

5-Cross Validation

### The used two regression models

1- linear regression model

2- ridge regression model
